A couple years ago, my inner cartographer was ecstatically intrigued by Google's WebGL Globe. Sadly, my just then forming, outer codeographer, was far too juvenile to understand how to work with the project.
In the last few months Iâ€™ve been quickly picking up web design skills so back round the globe I go!
